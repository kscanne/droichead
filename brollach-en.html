<h2>“Is iomaí cor i saol an fhocail”</h2>
<p>
These aim of this site is to provide Irish language scholars
or anyone interested in the etymology of Irish
with a “bridge” linking entries in the standard reference dictionary
for Modern Irish
(Ó Dónaill's <i>Foclóir Gaeilge-Béarla</i> (FGB), as found on
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.teanglann.ie/en/">teanglann.ie</a>)
with entries in the standard dictionary of Old/Middle Irish
(the Royal Irish Academy's <i>Dictionary of the Irish Language</i> (DIL),
as digitized on
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.dil.ie/">dil.ie</a>).
</p>

<p>
The mappings here are based on the ones recorded by
Tomás de&nbsp;Bhaldraithe in his <i>Innéacs Nua-Ghaeilge</i>,
published by the Royal Irish Academy in 1977, and I'm grateful
to the Academy for allowing me to make this valuable resource
available online (it is also the source of the quote in the
heading above). Prof. de&nbsp;Bhaldraithe's work has
been transformed and improved in a number of ways to facilitate
the creation of the hyperlinks you'll find here:
<p>

<ul>
<li>I have added parts of speech for all of the entries in FGB
(there are none in the <i>Innéacs</i>), which helps disambiguate many cases
(especially nouns and adjectives with the same spelling).</li>
<li>The disambiguations that exist in the <i>Innéacs</i> are given as
short English glosses, e.g. <i>barrann 'surpass'</i> vs.
<i>barrann 'hinder'</i>.  I have manually mapped each of these cases to
a specific headword in FGB (in these two examples, <i>barr<sup>3</sup></i>
and <i>barr<sup>4</sup></i> respectively).</li>
<li>Disambiguations on the DIL side are given as numbered senses
(<i>acht 3, acht 4, acht 6</i>, etc.) but not on a consistent basis.  
I manually linked the correct numbered eDIL entry in all ambiguous cases.</li>
<li>In cases where an alternate spelling in modern Irish was closer
to the spelling in DIL, de&nbsp;Bhaldraithe chose
the alterate spelling in his mappings
(he mentions <i>geafta : gepta</i> in the
Introduction). Since these words are not always linkable
on teanglann.ie, I have replaced all such alternate spellings with
the corresponding headword in FGB.</li>
<li>Many of the entries in the <i>Innéacs</i> are abbreviated
(e.g. <i>ciamhair, -e : ciabair, ciamair, -e</i>).  All of these 
abbreviations have been expanded, which was not entirely trivial to 
automate since there are cases that involve more than a simple appending
(e.g. <i>crístamail, -mlacht</i>, etc.).</li>
<li>Verbs in the <i>Innéacs</i> are given by their present tense form
(e.g. <i>diomlaíonn</i>); all such forms were replaced by the
singular imperative (e.g. <i>diomail</i>) to enable linking with FGB,
where this is the convention for verbs.</li>
<li>de&nbsp;Bhaldraithe intentionally omitted fadas on vowel combinations like
<i>ae, oe, eo, ua, ia</i>; those have been restored when needed to map to
a headword in eDIL.</li>
<li>Most painful of all was the fact that there were several hundred 
spelling inconsistencies in the <i>Innéacs</i>, mostly on the DIL side, that needed
to be corrected in order to link up with the correct eDIL entry
(e.g. deithnesech → deithnesach, eterchert → etercert,
meanmnaigid → menmnaigid, sligén → slicén,
etc.; a full list is available upon request).</li>
<li>When a linked word is not a headword in DIL, the <i>Innéacs</i> provides
specific page/line numbers in the print edition to where the word appears
(e.g. <i>ceannliath : cenn 127.43</i>). Since those
subentries are not directly linkable in the current version of eDIL, we
provide a link to the headword and you'll need to search from there.</li>
</ul>

encouragment and advice while I was working on this project.
